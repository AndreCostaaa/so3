### Initial setup

#### Pre-requisite

The [*Linaro arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain*][^1] must be installed. Version 6.4.1 has been successfully tested, but more recent versions should be fine.

### Files and directory organization

The SO3 tree is organized in two main parts: **kernel** and **user** space files. All kernel space related files are located in "***so3/***" while the user space files resides in "***usr/***".

The SO3 user space libc is based on the [*musl library*][^2]

### Quick setup & early test

The following commands is helpful to have quick up-and-running environment with SO3, i.e.Â a shell running on top of the kernel in the emulated *vExpress* environment.

#### Building Qemu

The emulator must be built in *qemu/* using the command line described in README.so3 followed by invoking make (-j8 means parallel building on 8 cores):
```
cd qemu
./configure \--target-list=arm-softmmu \--disable-attr \--disable-werror \--disable-docs
make -j8
```

#### Compiling U-boot

U-boot is used as initial bootloader. It will be possible to start an ITB image file containing the kernel, the device tree and an initrd filesystem. In u-boot/ directory:

```
cd u-boot\
make vexpress\_defconfig\
make -j8
```

#### Creating the virtual disk image

In *filesystem/* directory, create a virtual disk image with the following script:

```
cd filesystem\
./create\_img.sh vexpress
```

#### Compiling the user space

To build the user space applications, go to *usr/* directory and simply do make:

```
cd usr\
make
```

#### Compiling the kernel space

The kernel has to be compiled in *so3*/ after choosing a configuration:

```
cd so3\
make vexpress\_mmc\_defconfig\
make
```

At this point, all necessary components have been built. Now comes the phase of deployment in the virtual disk. This done by means of the deploy.sh script located at the root tree.

Currently, you should only use option b and u to deploy the ITB image as well as the user apps.

```
./deploy.sh -bu
```

#### Starting SO3

Simply invoking the script st as following:

```
./st
```

and you should run into the shell...

### Default configurations

This section describes the default configurations of the SO3 kernel which are present in "*so3/configs/*".

#### *vExpress* platform

  *vexpress\_ramfs\_defconfig*    Basic environment with a rootfs in RAM (*ramfs*)
  ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *vexpress\_mmc\_defconfig*      Basic environment with a separate *rootfs* needed to be stored in an MMC partition
  *vexpress\_thread\_defconfig*   Basic environment with no process support, hence no *user space*.
  *vexpress\_nommu\_defconfig*    The MMU is disabled and only threads are available (no process/*user space*).
  *vexpress\_net\_defconfig*      Environment with networking support (*lwip*)
  *vexpress\_fb\_defconfig*       Environment with LVGL and framebuffer support
  *vexpress\_full\_defconfig*     Complete environment with networking and framebuffer support

#### *Raspberry Pi 4* platform

Currently, there is only one default configuration file called *rpi4\_defconfig* which has a basic environment, without networking and framebuffer support.

The drivers required for networking and graphics are not available yet.
