Integration of LVGL in SO3
--------------------------

The major work of porting LVGL in SO3 has been done by Nikolaos Garanis in the context of his Diploma work.

Some details about the porting can be found in our `discussion forum <https://discourse.heig-vd.ch/t/graphics-support-for-so3/41/18>`__.

A small video to show LVGL running in the QEMU/vExpress framebuffer emulated environment.
